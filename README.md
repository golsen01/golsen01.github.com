===================

I believe I implemented all aspects correctly. My 3 html files and 2 css files checked out with the validator.
All my styling was done in css. 

I know that I implemented my background in sort of a hackjob way. I did this because I couldn't find out
how to decrease the opacity of a background image so that it would not interfere with my text. So I just
made it a regular image of fixed location, behind everything. This way it fills the page and it is possible
to make it more translucent.
However, I ran into problems when I tried to make the mobile css. My roommate's phone did not seem
to understand that the image was translucent or that it was behind everything else. So for the mobile css
I nixed the image completely, which is lame, but hey, no one said we needed a background anyway.

I did not work with anyone on this project.

I spent about 4 hours on this project.
