I was able to correctly implement the code, though I thought for several hours
that it was wrong. I didn't have a device to test the code on, so I was using
a Chrome extension that lets you see websites as their mobile versions. It works
for other websites, but for some reason it still gave me no dice. Finally I got 
my friend (Jesse Eaton) to load it on his phone and it got dice, so I guess it works??


I spent about twenty minutes writing this and a few hours testing it.
